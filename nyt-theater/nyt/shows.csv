4285,Landscape of the Body,2006-04-16,2006-04-17,By Ben Brantley,Gold Lamé Dreams Dashed by Polyester Reality in 'Landscape of the Body',"Rosalie, who was killed on a Greenwich Village sidewalk by a 10-speed yellow Raleigh bicycle in the mid-1970's, has to be the most appealing ghost in all of haunted New York. Played in high style (and clingy white satin) by Sherie Rene Scott in the Signature Theater Company's terrific revival of John Guare's ''Landscape of the Body,'' Rosalie is a funny, stand-up stunner who cracks jokes like a Catskills comic, dances like a vaudevillian trouper and sings like an earthy angel.     But what really makes us melt for Rosalie is her poignant way of looking back on the world she has left. Oh, sure, she says it's great to be dead. It's what she has always wanted. But as she narrates the sweet and sordid saga of her sister, a murder suspect named Betty (portrayed by the peerless Lili Taylor), Rosalie reveals an endless ache of longing for life on earth. You can tell this from her hungry expression as she watches her sister smoking dope or going to bed with her sleazy boss -- you know, the little things. No matter what she says, Rosalie wants to be where she can't be.  ",https://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/17/theater/reviews/gold-lame-dreams-dashed-by-polyester-reality-in-landscape.html,true,,,,,,,

Dooley, much less that of his creator, Finley Peter Dunne. Mr. Dooley was a fictional Irish pub owner who, with Dunne's help, wrote satiric daily editorials in The Chicago Evening Post about the issues of the day.      ''Mr. Dooley's America,'' written in 1976 by the screenwriter Philip Dunne and Martin Blaine, shares the wisdom of the columns, presumably to make the point that nothing much has changed. If, as Dooley's customer Mr. Hennessy says, ''The whole country is going to the Devil,'' it certainly has been happening for a long time. The likable current production at the Irish Repertory Theater conveys that in no uncertain terms.

Over the next six weeks, theatergoers will discover a production that has matured through three London engagements (the first two, separated by six months, took place last year on the Royal Court's pair of stages), even if the work remains an impassioned eulogy that isn't quite the same thing as a play.

Jude Narita's one-woman show ''Walk the Mountain,'' about the hellish effects of the Vietnam War, reminds us that it's possible for a performer to treat both her material and her audience with respect.     Ms. Narita used interviews with Vietnamese and Cambodian women who lived through the conflict to shape a nuanced account of their lives. Interspersing her monologue with photographs, film clips, facts and quotations, she portrays strong female characters: a warrior, a doctor, a student, an activist. We see Vietnamese women defending their country for as long as it's been prey to invaders, from the Trung sisters, who fought off the Chinese in A.D. 39, to those who helped battle the French, the Japanese, the French again, and then, of course, the United States.

5061,Other Desert Cities,2011-01-13,2006-04-18,By George Hunka,"In 'Desert Sunrise,' a West Bank 'Godot'","Two men spend several hours as the only figures in a vast, empty landscape. To kill the time, they bicker, tell jokes and stories and express affection for each other. But this isn't a country road, and there's no tree. Instead, it's a desert wadi, or valley, in the Israeli-occupied West Bank; the two men are an Israeli soldier and a Palestinian shepherd; and the person for whom they are waiting may or may not be a suicide bomber.     Now in an all-too-brief encore engagement at the Theater for the New City, Misha Shulman's elegant and affecting ''Desert Sunrise'' makes the most of its modest and familiar narrative, and like Samuel Beckett's classic, elicits a tragicomic resonance. Fear drives the initial confrontation between the Israeli, Tsahi (a bright, driven Jared Miller), and the Palestinian, Ismail (a haunting, caustic Haythem Noor), but as the night deepens, they begin to share their very pedestrian concerns: Tsahi has just broken up with his girlfriend; Ismail is waiting for his.

Raphael Lemkin, a real-life lawyer who died in 1959, learns this in his imagined afterlife in ''Lemkin's House,'' a compelling, well-acted play by Catherine Filloux at the 78th Street Theater Lab.      Lemkin, who fled Poland in 1939 and eventually ended up in the United States, is associated with one particular word: genocide, which he coined in the 1940's. (''Genos: from the Greek, meaning race, tribe,'' his character says in the play. ''Cide: Latin; to kill. Race-murder.'') He campaigned to make it an international crime, with the United States particularly slow to endorse his treaty. But in Ms. Filloux's stark afterlife, he has reason to wonder whether any of his efforts were worthwhile, as he is visited by victims and perpetrators of some present-day genocides. Rwanda receives particular attention.  ",https://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/11/theater/reviews/genocide-and-a-lawyers-afterlife-lemkins-house.html,true,,,,,,,

But ''Paradise Lost,'' a sung-through musical take on the Milton epic at the Producer's Club II, does a fair amount with a shoestring. This ambitious attempt by the young team of Benjamin Birney (music and lyrics) and Rob Seitelman (lyrics and direction) may not be the most marketable musical in the world -- beware any play where Satan (Paul A.

4193,"Almost, Maine",2006-01-12,2006-01-16,By Charles Isherwood,"Down East, So Much Love, Exciting and New","Kisses come out of nowhere in the new play ''Almost, Maine,'' but they go nowhere fast. A comedy comprising almost a dozen two-character vignettes exploring the sudden thunderclap of love and the scorched earth that sometimes follows, John Cariani's play will evoke either awww's or ick's, depending on your affection for its whimsical approach to the joys and perils of romance.     Four actors portray nearly 20 characters in this collection of loosely linked stories, which opened on Thursday at the Daryl Roth Theater. All inhabit the same lonely landscape at the top of the Eastern Seaboard, where, it seems, a whole host of quirks, psychological tics and even magical happenings bloom beneath the snowdrifts.

5708,"Almost, Maine",2014-02-04,2006-01-16,By Charles Isherwood,"Down East, So Much Love, Exciting and New","Kisses come out of nowhere in the new play ''Almost, Maine,'' but they go nowhere fast. A comedy comprising almost a dozen two-character vignettes exploring the sudden thunderclap of love and the scorched earth that sometimes follows, John Cariani's play will evoke either awww's or ick's, depending on your affection for its whimsical approach to the joys and perils of romance.     Four actors portray nearly 20 characters in this collection of loosely linked stories, which opened on Thursday at the Daryl Roth Theater. All inhabit the same lonely landscape at the top of the Eastern Seaboard, where, it seems, a whole host of quirks, psychological tics and even magical happenings bloom beneath the snowdrifts. Echoing the offbeat sensibility of the television series ''Northern Exposure,'' Mr. Cariani, who grew up in rural Maine, is working from the notion that the remoter expanses of the country are the natural harbor of the adorably lovelorn, the touched and the irretrievably lost.

3686,Altar Boyz,2005-03-01,2005-12-23,By Jason Zinoman,Revisiting Those Hunks of Faith Tempted in Manhattan,"There are two types of guilty pleasures in New York theater. The first, the disastrous idea so pitifully executed that it's worth an evening just for the schadenfreude, comes along every few months. The second, less common, also involves a laughable idea, but one that is performed and designed so expertly that it almost convinces you otherwise.      ''Altar Boyz,'' a satire about a Christian boy band that makes the Backstreet Boys look like gangsta rappers, is a premier example of the latter. This 90-minute parody seemed like a surefire bust when it opened in March. The boy-band trend had already petered out, and the conceit that a pop group was going to cleanse the souls of its audience -- measuring every sinful person with a device called the soul sensor -- sounded, well, less than promising. But thanks to five dynamite performances and songs convincing enough to be played on MTV, the show became an unlikely hit.

4353,AMAJUBA: Like Doves We Rise,2006-07-25,2006-07-26,By Charles Isherwood,Amajuba: Like Doves We Rise: Apartheids Private Pain Becomes Group Art,"Tormenting memories dissolve into soaring music, and pain is salved by a collective embrace in ''Amajuba: Like Doves We Rise,'' a heartfelt, powerfully performed theater piece that opened last night at the Culture Project. Using just the basic resources of the stage -- words and music, light and darkness, stillness and movement -- the five actors and authors of ''Amajuba'' sift through the past, searching to transcend its wounds by taming the ghosts of history.     Theater as therapy? It's a durable if often tedious genre, but the stories told here are of more than purely personal interest. The cast of ''Amajuba'' grew up in South African townships during the apartheid years. The social and political legacies of that repellent system have been the subject of much wide-focus journalism in the years since it was abolished. ''Amajuba'' reminds us that the continuing struggle and suffering of individuals underlie those assessments. The poisons bred by injustice do not disappear with a change of policy, and the sweep of what we come to call progress does not erase the scars of history's victims.

2700,American Dreams: Lost and Found,2003-05-13,2006-08-25,By Ben Brantley,Weaving Blues of Trying Times and Lost Dreams,"LIFE and death dance cheek to cheek, like impatient lovers waltzing toward bed, in the fine new revival of August Wilson's ''Seven Guitars,'' which opened last night at the Peter Norton Space of the Signature Theater Company.     For the characters in this rich, music-drenched drama, produced on Broadway in 1996, the thread of human existence is both bright and tenuous, liable to snap without warning at any moment. None of the seven African-Americans who share a neighborhood and shifting dreams of conquest in ''Seven Guitars,'' set in the Hill District of Pittsburgh in 1948, denies or runs from the fact of their mortality.

When Mr. Cook reaches for broader statements about humanity, though, those strengths of observation and humor fall by the wayside.     This elegant and precise production by the Gotham Stage Company, staged by Alex Lippard, combines Western realistic and Japanese Noh theater techniques. It is at its best in the first half of the 100-minute, intermissionless evening, as three 20-something English-language teachers are invited to share their stories on the last night of their visits to Japan. The uptight British graduate of Oxford, the gay but virginal American Southerner, and the hostile and sarcastic Canadian woman reveal small epiphanies that have affected their ways of dealing with loss, isolation and death, epiphanies that have their origins in the confusing culture in which they find themselves.

Floorboards might as well be skateboards in the old Brooklyn brownstone that is the setting for ''Satellites,'' the tough-minded, softhearted and very likable new play by Diana Son that opened last night at the Public Theater.      Thanks to the ingenuity of the set designer Mark Wendland, rooms slide sideways, backward and forward in this study of big-city identity crises from the author of ''Stop Kiss.'' A seemingly solid structure splits again and again into a house divided, as distinctions between outdoors and indoors, between public and private, melt and dissolve. For Nina (Sandra Oh) and Miles (Kevin Carroll), a couple who have just moved from Manhattan with their newborn daughter, home has all the stability of a runaway taxi.

The Jean Cocteau Repertory manages it with George Bernard Shaw's ''Candida,'' and -- though perhaps this is the television-raised, frequent-commercial-interruption generation talking -- it feels great. Maybe we've lost something in the shift to one- or no-intermission plays: the chance to mill and mull while the story is still unfolding.      The play is the middle production of a season the company is billing as ''five fascinating women,'' though Candida (Amanda Jones) is fairly lightweight compared with, say, the heroine of ''Medea,'' the preceding play. Shaw's century-old domestic comedy is not really about its title character anyway, except late in the game when she gets a chance to spout some primitive women's liberation rhetoric.

Yet the stage feels as crowded and as solitary as a big-city subway at rush hour -- dense with urban lives rubbing against one another while never making contact. To exist is to be alone in Mr. McPherson's Dublin, but it is also to be painfully aware of the countless other lives that touch upon yours. Touching upon, of course, is not the same as actually touching.     Given such a worldview, it seems natural that Mr. McPherson, the author of quintessentially Irish exercises in storytelling like ''The Weir'' and ''This Lime Tree Bower,'' should have hitherto favored the monologue as his form of choice. With ''Shining City,'' which is set in the first office of an untried therapist played by Brian F. O'Byrne, Mr. McPherson forces his characters out of the safe houses of their soliloquies and makes them talk to one another. It is hardly surprising that many of their sentences end with the wan, hopeful words, ''You know?''

And if an actor wants to prove that he can do heterosexual and hateable as smoothly as he can do homosexual and lovable, who better to go to than Neil LaBute, whose slight and sour comedy ''SomeGirl(s)'' opened last night at the Lucille Lortel Theater.     As both dramatist (''Fat Pig'') and filmmaker (''In the Company of Men''), Mr. LaBute has built a prolific career on vivisecting the unfair sex, with clinically contemptuous works that put the human male under a microscope and watch the little sucker squirm. Both moralistic and voyeuristic, his plays and movies seem always to be writhing in some ecstasy of self-flagellation, whispering all the while, ''Oh, guys, we're bad, bad, bad -- jerks, lowlife, pond scum.'' If there is masochism in the implicit litany, there is self-stroking smugness as well.  ",https://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/09/theater/reviews/in-some-girls-a-pond-scums-love-song.html,true,,,,,,,

The 1980's, it seems, are to today what the 1950's were to the 1970's (and to part of the 1980's): a supposedly more innocent, picturesquely dopey time when people wore quaint clothes, listened to infectiously inane music and danced goofy tribal dances. Ah, how we laughed.     Hence the return of big hair and shoulders to fashion's runways; the preponderance of Web sites with names like ''inthe80s.com''; and animated television scrapbooks, like ''I Love the 80's'' on VH1, where third-tier celebrities provide snarky commentary about their favorite period bands, movies and celebrities. And now, mining the same much-plundered vein, is ''The Wedding Singer,'' the assembly-kit musical that opened last night at the Al Hirschfeld Theater and might as well be called ''That 80's Show.''

4589,Spain,2007-10-30,2006-01-11,By Charles Isherwood,"Spanish Triangle: Father, Daughter, Lad","As a quick, cut-price tour of the sights and sounds of southern Spain, the Manhattan Theater Club production of ''Beauty of the Father,'' the new play by Nilo Cruz, is an indisputable success. A guitar strums hypnotically in the background of several scenes, while at one point the click of castanets is heard. An inviting expanse of seascape laps across the back wall of the set. When the play's characters settle down to a picnic on the beach in the second act, you can almost feel the itch of sand between your toes.     That is not the only uncomfortable sensation this torpid play may give rise to, unfortunately. Mr. Cruz favors atmosphere over cut-and-dried drama, a dramatic strategy that was more effectively deployed in his Pulitzer Prize-winning ''Anna in the Tropics.'' A crisp outline of his new play's plot might suggest the crazy-quilt melodramas of early Almodóvar: father and daughter are attracted to the same sexy bad boy, igniting all manner of emotional fireworks. But Mr. Cruz's reflective, unhurried pace and his meandering, lyrical dialogue allow his fuses to burn a little too long, resulting in more fizzle than flash.

Neuropsychiatric Hospital, is priceless. If an actress is going to share the story of her insanity, Ms. Gleason in her hearty one-woman show, ''Stopping Traffic,'' has found the way to do it.     Ms. Gleason, performing at the Vineyard Theater, is one of that admirable breed: the working actress. Over the last quarter-century or so, she has appeared in close to a hundred movies and television episodes, not to mention what she describes as ''very, very bad Off Off Off Broadway theater.'' The only trouble has been the occasional manic episode, since she learned during her early years in New York that she suffered from bipolar disorder.

6278,The Babies,2016-10-27,2006-05-19,By Charles Isherwood,"It Looks Like a Baby, but It's Really a Starter's Pistol in 'The Race'","Impending fatherhood stuns a man almost speechless in ''The Race,'' a brisk trot through nine months of anxiety that is playing at the 59E59 Theaters as part of the Brits Off Broadway festival. The father-to-be stutters and mutters, gapes and gasps out the usual responses -- so proud, such a responsibility -- but his restless body telegraphs a more visceral response. Too scared to sit still and ponder the reordering of his laddish life, he just keeps moving.     Performed by the London-based troupe Gecko, ''The Race'' is a hybrid of theater and dance, and lasts just an hour. With its five performers breaking into a jog at regular intervals and rarely slowing down to a stroll, it certainly feels like a run, albeit one that freezes in place every few minutes for a silly or striking image evoking the dazed inner landscape of the unnamed central character.

Robert Oppenheimer'' is in terms of present-day politics.      ''There are people who are willing to protect freedom until there is nothing left of it,'' the title character says to an unfriendly lawyer. Comments like that are highly satisfying for theatergoers who, like Oppenheimer, reside happily on the left side of politics. But the play, now at the Connelly Theater in the East Village, looks at even broader issues.

This engaging if too tidy domestic drama about conflicts of family and of faith, which opened last night at Playwrights Horizons, is essentially a tale of a loving mother, a troubled son and the man who may be able to heal the breach between them. But Mr. Bunin expands its scope with considered discussions of the church's tense relationship with its gay members, as well as with the more arcane issue of the Bible as a literary construct, as opposed to the official word of God.

5654,The Civil War,2013-07-18,2006-03-25,By Neil Genzlinger,"In 'Shiloh Rules,' a Comedy, Civil War Re-enactors Do Battle","It's not easy finding a new take on something as heavily scrutinized as the Civil War, but Doris Baizley has done it in ''Shiloh Rules,'' an inventive comedy with some drama, history and first-aid tips thrown in. Sterling performances by the six-member, all-female cast make the production, by the Flying Fig Theater and Middle Tennessee State University, a rewarding trip back to, well, the present.     The play is set not during the Battle of Shiloh, in 1862, but during a modern-day re-enactment of it. Two veteran re-enactors, one playing a Union nurse named Clara (Kate Weiman) and another playing a Confederate refugee named Cecelia (Cordis Heard), have a bit of a history as a result of previous encounters at the annual event in Tennessee, and this year each has a trainee in tow: Meg (Janine Kyanko) for the North, LucyGale (Judi Lewis Ockler) for the South.

4343,The Field,2006-06-01,2006-06-02,By Charles Isherwood,"In 'The Field,' Love for the Land Is Fierce and Brutal","In ''The Field'' John B. Keane draws a portrait of rural life in Ireland in the mid-20th century that is both loving and damning, sorrowful and censorious. In the hearts of villagers involved in the cover-up of an act of violence, cowardice and an easy accommodation with brutality sit alongside a robust humor, loyalty to clan and class, and a fierce love of the land.     Those virtues ennoble -- or at least explain -- the morally destructive compromises the characters are forced to make to guarantee the survival of their way of life. The mournful larger question raised by ''The Field,'' written and set in 1964, is whether a culture so poisoned by corruption is worth preserving.

4225,The God Committee,2006-03-29,2006-04-01,By Anne Midgette,"In 'The God Committee,' a Life-and-Death Debate","When a play aims to convey a Message -- with a capital M -- it's the equivalent of a yellow flag on the racetrack: everyone involved should proceed with caution. ''The God Committee,'' which opened on Wednesday at the Lamb's Theater, is about organ donation and the moral, ethical and emotional debate that surrounds it. It's even sponsored by the New York Organ Donor Network, which has a table in the lobby to capitalize on the right-mindedness the play is striving to provoke.      I'm all for organ donation. But this positive feeling does not automatically transfer to a play that comes off as a self-conscious cross between ''Twelve Angry Men'' and the television show ''ER.'' Written by Mark St. Germain, whose considerable credits extend from ''The Cosby Show'' to ''Forgiving Typhoid Mary,'' it's a polished work that draws on the lingua franca established by television hospital dramas (sometimes to its detriment; we all know a resident would never dare to be so outspoken in a meeting of her superiors, were it not necessary for the advancement of the plot) to create a debate of ideas that hits all the requisite climaxes without being entirely convincing emotionally.

4303,The House in Town,2006-06-19,2006-06-20,By Charles Isherwood,'The House in Town' Provides Scenes From a Pre-Crash Marriage,"A busy season for Richard Greenberg fizzles to a close with ''The House in Town,'' a wan new drama about an American marriage slowly imploding in the days before the country's economy did the same, more suddenly and spectacularly, back in 1929.     Mr. Greenberg, arguably our most prolific playwright, has had an annus horribilis on Broadway. Or at least an annus not-so-goodilis. His comedy ''A Naked Girl on the Appian Way'' was shredded by critics last fall, and the star-driven revival of ''Three Days of Rain'' proved to be a supernova only at the box office. It was to be hoped that Mr. Greenberg's return to Off Broadway, where much of his best work (including the Tony-winning ''Take Me Out'') has often been nurtured before moving on to headier climes, would mark a happy return to form.

Think again, disco boys and girls. Why right now -- on the very spot where Halston, Liza, Bianca and Andy once held sybaritic court -- you can watch the same kinds of revels they might have witnessed in the 1970's, thanks to the shrill, numbing revival of ''The Threepenny Opera'' that opened at the theater at Studio 54 last night.     Cross-dressed men and women in writhing sexual pretzels; leather boys and glitter queens vacuuming up piles of snow with their nostrils; strobe lights, neon lights and, yes, disco-ball lights. There's even a bare-chested hunk in a gold lamé bathing suit who arrives on a flying golden horse, summoning sweet memories of that fab birthday party for Bianca. (Or was it Liz?)

The second character, very much a supporting one, is, let's say, someone like you.     While the martini glasses or coffee cups are slowly drained, chatty soul complains about the unending stresses of that job before moving on to bemoan the difficulty of sustaining a relationship in the heady swirl of city life.

It opened last night at the Lyceum Theater, 149 West 45th Street; (212) 239-6200. Following are excerpts from Ben Brantley's review, which appeared in The New York Times on Feb. 28; the full text is online at nytimes.com/theater.       Blood winds up on pretty much every surface in ''The Lieutenant of Inishmore,'' Martin McDonagh's gleeful, gruesome play about political terrorism in rural Ireland, which won the Olivier Award (the British equivalent of the Tony) for best comedy. The red stuff is splashed, spattered and smeared over walls, floors, furniture, clothes, skin and cat's fur. The fur is the main thing. For it is a mutilated cat that sets off the Euripidean cycle of murderous revenge that occupies two fast hours of hit-and-run traffic on the stage.

Will Frears, the director of the amiable, lightweight revival at the Williamstown Theater Festival here, has said he sees ''Bus Stop'' as belonging to a more hopeful time that believed in ''the possible triumph of love.''     But what really anchors the play irretrievably to the 1950's are two women of forbidding iconic stature: Kim Stanley, who starred as Cherie, the chanteuse (to be pronounced chan-tooze) from the Ozarks when ''Bus Stop'' opened on Broadway, and Marilyn Monroe, who portrayed the character in the 1956 film. The play confirmed stargazers' visions of Stanley, an exemplary product of the Actors Studio, as a comet of rare and fiery talent; the film proved conclusively that Monroe was more than a bounteous torso.

There was the time two planes collided above his childhood home in Montana, and bodies rained from the sky. One day he entered his grandparents' kitchen just in time to watch his grandmother clutch her heart and die. And sometimes his depressive father would go days without saying a word.     The hardest part, Mr. Bowers demonstrates in ''It Goes Without Saying,'' his zestful and endearing one-man show at Rattlestick Playwrights Theater, was that no one talked about any of it. So no one said much about the Tonka incident. When young Bill's concerned parents gave him toy trucks, he used them to facilitate his Barbie parades. Here we have a classic story of growing up gay in an emotionally repressed 20th-century American family.  ",https://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/09/theater/reviews/a-mime-and-his-memories.html,true,,,,,,,

At Monday night's performance of the Millennium Talent Group's rowdy, colorful ''Tempest Tossed Fools,'' for instance, when the King of Naples wailed about where his missing son might be, one little girl in the audience piped up, ''I think he's behind that curtain.'' She repeated her comment several times but was ignored.     Otherwise the interaction seemed to go according to plan, with children calling out animal names when asked and going onstage to dance; making wind, rain and lightning noises; and participating in a particularly undemanding limbo contest.

6517,The Trials of Oz,1972-12-19,2006-01-10,By Miriam Horn,"Australian Teenage Drama, Conjured Out of Thin Air","Toward the end of ''The Stones,'' an extraordinary two-man show for teenage audiences by the Zeal Theater Company of Australia, a 13-year-old boy awaiting trial for a prank turned deadly is caught in a recurring nightmare. His 15-year-old partner in crime is daring him to climb an immense ladder to nowhere, taunting him with scornful clucking. In a feat of acrobatic magic, the older boy (played by Zeal's middle-aged artistic director, Stefo Nantsou) has balanced the ladder, unsupported, on a sawhorse; if it falls, it will slice through the audience. He finally persuades the younger boy (the silver-haired Tom Lycos) to make the climb by promising to hold the ladder steady. But when the slight, trembling child reaches the top rung, his friend begins to peel away his fingers, excoriating the little one for confessing their deed.     That tension -- entangling and implicating the audience -- is sustained throughout this burning one-hour show, which was inspired by the 1994 trial of two Melbourne teenagers who killed a passing motorist by kicking rocks off a freeway overpass. Working like street clowns with the sparest of means, the two performers (never given names) abuse each other with a foul, funny ''South Park'' patois and jam -- expertly -- on electric guitars, pumping themselves up for trouble, providing a thrilling soundtrack for rebellion. Without sets or elaborate props they conjure everything out of thin air, with their guitars and bodies adding a range of witty sound effects, from the background drone of television to the trailing echoes of a sewer.

She's a kittenish office temp with an agenda. It's a slow night at the firm on a Friday in August. So far so clear? Nelson Avidon's dramedy, ''Girl in Heat,'' is what you imagine, and then it isn't, mostly because of the performances in this two-hander at the Michael Weller Theater.      Mr. Avidon, who has written a very funny visual joke for himself in the first few minutes of ''Girl in Heat,'' is an actor and playwright and the production's major producer. He is also a lifetime member of the Actors Studio, according to his program biography, and his somewhat glib, predictable script, propelled by its dialogue volleys -- several of them unprintable in this newspaper -- could be divided into a series of scenes for class.

4289,The Water's Edge,2006-06-14,2006-06-15,By Ben Brantley,"Kate Burton, Carrying a Load of Grief in 'The Water's Edge'","In a bold surgical endeavor that recalls the experiments of the mad Dr. Frankenstein, Theresa Rebeck has tried to transplant the big, blood-gorged heart of a Greek tragedy into the slender body of a modest American comic drama. The resulting self-sabotaging hybrid is called ''The Water's Edge,'' and it is quietly running amok in a stylishly acted production starring Kate Burton and Tony Goldwyn that opened last night at the Second Stage Theater.     This bizarre offering from the talented Ms. Rebeck harks to the days when the announcement ''Daddy's home'' really meant something. And I don't mean the happy family television comedies of the 1950's and 60's, like ''Father Knows Best.'' The model for ''The Water's Edge'' is a few thousand years older than that. Imagine, if you dare, Aeschylus's ''Agamemnon,'' the tale of the disastrous return of an arrogant king to his family after the Trojan War, reconceived as a blithe contemporary mini-series for HBO. Not for nothing does one of the characters observe, with more aptness than originality, ''Beware of Greeks bearing gifts.''

He stands perfectly still with a pistol in one hand, refusing one bribe after another. ''Give me back my arm!'' he says with a furious intensity. What happens next is surprising, but nowhere near as much as discovering that the author of this one-act -- ''The One-Armed Man,'' the highlight of the third series of the Ensemble Studio Theater's annual collection of short plays -- was Horton Foote.     Mr. Foote, the prolific playwright who won a Pulitzer Prize for ''The Young Man From Atlanta'' and wrote the screenplay for the film ''To Kill a Mockingbird,'' specializes in deeply felt quotidian dramas that have more in common with the work of Chekhov than Flannery O'Connor. If he is one of the least gothic Southern writers, you wouldn't know it from this haunting departure, cleverly staged by the veteran actor Harris Yulin.

3062,They Wrote That?,2004-02-05,2005-06-21,By Jason Zinoman,The Threat of Violence Compounded by More Violence,"A gruff one-armed man glowers at the manager of the cotton gin. He stands perfectly still with a pistol in one hand, refusing one bribe after another. ''Give me back my arm!'' he says with a furious intensity. What happens next is surprising, but nowhere near as much as discovering that the author of this one-act -- ''The One-Armed Man,'' the highlight of the third series of the Ensemble Studio Theater's annual collection of short plays -- was Horton Foote.     Mr. Foote, the prolific playwright who won a Pulitzer Prize for ''The Young Man From Atlanta'' and wrote the screenplay for the film ''To Kill a Mockingbird,'' specializes in deeply felt quotidian dramas that have more in common with the work of Chekhov than Flannery O'Connor. If he is one of the least gothic Southern writers, you wouldn't know it from this haunting departure, cleverly staged by the veteran actor Harris Yulin.

You, sir, have no business being on this particular creative team. Your collaborators are probably too polite, not to mention too deceased, to tell you this, so you'll have to read it here: Your characters are constructed of cardboard, your story arc flat-lines, your jokes are D.O.A. Please, find another line of work. Perhaps highway construction.      Mr. Turnpike is credited with the flimsy story that ties together more than 20 songs by a couple of fellows with better résumés, Richard Rodgers and Lorenz Hart. Pending DNA test results are expected to show that Mr. Turnpike is closely related to, or perhaps the very same person as, Isaiah Sheffer, the artistic director of Symphony Space, who has concocted this interesting if not entirely successful revue to inaugurate what he hopes will be a series called Summer Stock on Broadway.

5832,Time of My Life,2014-06-11,2006-02-24,By Jason Zinoman,I'm My Own Bombshell,"She had Marilyn Monroe-style hair, silky smooth skin and a knockout figure. But Christine Jorgensen wasn't always a beautiful woman; she wasn't a woman at all until she entered a Copenhagen hospital in 1952 and had a sex-change operation. The Daily News broke the story: ''Ex-G.I. Becomes Blonde Bombshell,'' read the headline that launched her celebrity, briefly making her one of the most famous women in the world.     Based on a fascinating historical document, ''Christine Jorgensen Reveals,'' which has already had runs at 59E59 Theaters and Dodger Stages before moving to Theater Row, is not your average biographical play. In a meticulous performance, Bradford Louryk lip-syncs an hourlong interview conducted in 1958 with Ms. Jorgensen by Nipsey Russell (Rob Grace), who struggles mightily to think up euphemisms for sex. ''Have you ever had any sincere entreaties for a romantic interlude?'' he asks with typical formality.  ",https://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/24/theater/reviews/im-my-own-bombshell.html,true,,,,,,,

5386,Title and Deed,2012-05-20,2006-02-18,By Honor Moore,"Good Deeds, of a Sort, Toward Forgiveness","If there is a coherent narrative in Michael John Garcés's ''Acts of Mercy: passion-play,'' it is resolutely kept from the audience. An evocative opening image of a dying man on a hospital bed, with a woman in white who seems almost to be an angel bent at his feet, prepares us for the drama of redemption suggested by the title. But the first scene in the hospital room, between half brothers, is played with a kind of would-be Pinter stylization that prevents engagement between the characters or emotional investment by the audience. For the record, according to the press release for the play, it is about two sons ''hoping to gain redemption through small but life-giving acts of mercy'' as they try to reconcile with their dying father.      As the evening progresses, it seems possible that the viewer is meant to discern the consequences of family trauma from the punchy, monosyllabic verbal combat and its repeated expletives, but any efforts to connect are continually frustrated.

No doubt naughty things were once scrawled on the walls of dank grottoes, inspiring snickers from cave men with low comic tastes, pained smiles from their more refined brethren. But as centuries pass, the language of the dirty joke and the lewd pun evolves, obscuring the ribaldry. Footnotes become necessary. Fun is spoiled.     Enter David Grimm, an ambitious playwright who laments how the vulgarity in old English stage comedies has become the subject of monographs, not the cause of belly laughs. In his new mock-Restoration comedy, ''Measure for Pleasure,'' which opened last night at the Public Theater, Mr. Grimm seeks to do a little restoration work of his own, inserting great chunks of fresh dirt into every nook, cranny and convention of a traditional form. A glossary is no longer required for jokes stripped of the obscuring drag of arcane language.

4172,Beauty of the Father,2006-01-10,2006-01-11,By Charles Isherwood,"Spanish Triangle: Father, Daughter, Lad","As a quick, cut-price tour of the sights and sounds of southern Spain, the Manhattan Theater Club production of ''Beauty of the Father,'' the new play by Nilo Cruz, is an indisputable success. A guitar strums hypnotically in the background of several scenes, while at one point the click of castanets is heard. An inviting expanse of seascape laps across the back wall of the set. When the play's characters settle down to a picnic on the beach in the second act, you can almost feel the itch of sand between your toes.     That is not the only uncomfortable sensation this torpid play may give rise to, unfortunately. Mr. Cruz favors atmosphere over cut-and-dried drama, a dramatic strategy that was more effectively deployed in his Pulitzer Prize-winning ''Anna in the Tropics.'' A crisp outline of his new play's plot might suggest the crazy-quilt melodramas of early Almodóvar: father and daughter are attracted to the same sexy bad boy, igniting all manner of emotional fireworks. But Mr. Cruz's reflective, unhurried pace and his meandering, lyrical dialogue allow his fuses to burn a little too long, resulting in more fizzle than flash.

McClatchy, the Lincoln Center Festival brought back a piece it first presented in 1997, Benjamin Bagby's bardic version of ''Beowulf.'' Both are based on the Anglo-Saxon epic about the exploits of Beowulf, the Swedish warrior who saves the Danes from the murderous monster Grendel, but the two works could hardly be more different.      Mr. Goldenthal's opera, based on John Gardner's novel, tells the story from Grendel's viewpoint. It is thoroughly modern in its perverse eagerness to upend the legend. Never mind that everyone from the story's creator to Mr. Gardner took Grendel as written: as a grotesque, bloodthirsty ogre, the classic terror by night. In the opera he's a sensitive, thoughtful soul.  ",https://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/20/theater/reviews/that-wellknown-story-of-beowulf-and-his-ogre.html,true,,,,,,,

On a stage with nine charismatic artists, Ms. Chin stood out as a ferocious and slyly funny poet with a skill for turning a clever phrase. With her appealing autobiographical show ''Border/Clash: A Litany of Desires,'' she has the stage to herself, and commands your attention.    With razor-sharp cheekbones and two voluminous puffs of hair resting on top of a delicate wisp of a body, Ms. Chin is a caricaturist's dream. Like Sarah Jones, another poetry slam artist who made the transition to straight theater -- her ''Bridge and Tunnel'' was also produced at 45 Bleecker -- Ms. Chin has the paper-thin figure of a movie star.

So if I may borrow a little vocabulary from the business pages, I am hereby putting a strong sell recommendation on ''Burleigh Grime$,'' a feeble-witted comedy about dirty dealings on Wall Street that opened last night at New World Stages.     Written by Roger Kirby and directed by David Warren, the play features a pair of skilled actors known for recent television work: Wendie Malick of ''Just Shoot Me'' and Mark Moses of ''Desperate Housewives.'' Incidental music is by David Yazbek, who wrote the score for Broadway's ''Dirty Rotten Scoundrels.'' These putative assets are, unfortunately, painfully ill served by Mr. Kirby's play, which is long on ludicrous plot and short on fresh humor.

4365,Everythings Turning Into Beautiful,2006-08-03,2006-08-04,By Ben Brantley,Everythings Turning Into Beautiful: Tunesmiths in Love,"A quick thrill of nostalgia for a nearly forgotten season ripples through the opening moments of ''Everythings Turning Into Beautiful,'' the generally thrill-free demi-musical that opened last night at the Acorn Theater at Theater Row. You have to understand that Seth Zvi Rosenfeld's play, with songs by Jimmie James, is set in the wintertime. When first seen, its two characters are wearing things like sweaters, knitted caps and heavy jackets and appear to be really cold, even though they're indoors. Golly, remember what it was like to be cold? Wasn't it bliss?     With temperatures that turn human flesh into salt water, this has been one of those embarrassing weeks when the weather dominates and warps thought and conversation. So forgive me if, at the beginning of that nasty stretch called August in Manhattan, I find disproportionate merit in a show's being set in this city in December (on Christmas Eve to be exact). And having arrived at the Acorn in a limp and dingy state, I can't help getting misty about the exquisite state of the air conditioning there.

6566,First Love,2018-06-14,2005-06-22,By Jason Zinoman,Love Triangle at the Garden,"It was bigger than Michael, Martha and maybe even O.J. When the eccentric millionaire Harry K. Thaw shot and killed the famed architect Stanford White on the roof of the old Madison Square Garden almost a century ago, the subsequent ''trial of the century,'' the first of many in the 20th, was a perfect storm of celebrity scandal. There was a bit of everything: wealth, fame, insanity, genius and, in the middle of it all, a beautiful chorus girl, Evelyn Nesbit, who was married to Thaw and slept with White.     The sensational story has been adapted for screen and stage (most recently in the Broadway musical ''Ragtime''), but the latest play, Don Nigro's ''My Sweetheart's the Man in the Moon,'' might be its most faithful version. It demonstrates admirable nuance and an impressive amount of research, but its respectable tone seems to miss the point.

Glover as the Englishman Henry Smithers and Sheila Dabney as everybody else, including the chorus. The set is nothing but bare raised platforms; the audience is invited to conjure its own scenery as Ms. Dabney and sometimes Mr. Gaines read O'Neill's vivid set descriptions and stage directions. The playing space, a large, deep rectangle that makes you feel as if you are peering into a diorama, is awash in eerie sound (credited to Mr. Adair), including those tom-toms O'Neill specified.

4212,Funnyhouse of a Negro,2006-01-20,2006-01-25,By Neil Genzlinger,The Nightmare Within: Battling the Internalized Color Line,"The Civil War ended slavery, but it did nothing to stop the grinding away of black identity that was at the heart of the trade. For a century afterward, black Americans were pressured, both subtly and brutally, to deny the past and to adapt to white culture; in the coming PBS special ''African American Lives,'' some of today's most prominent black Americans tell of childhoods in which relatives actively avoided discussing family roots.      ''Funnyhouse of a Negro,'' Adrienne Kennedy's 1964 one-act play set, essentially, inside the head of a disturbed young black woman named Sarah, catches perfectly that moment in time when the struggle could have gone either way: black identity might have been erased, or it might have reasserted itself. We know now what happened: black power, black is beautiful. That perspective makes Ms. Kennedy's play, being given a somewhat uneven production by the Classical Theater of Harlem, doubly interesting. It's still a fearlessly innovative piece of theater, but it's also a period piece.

6810,Games,2019-10-10,2006-01-21,By Jason Zinoman,"Games, Guns and a Message","The experimental theater is hooked on television. It's getting to the point where you can't see a show Off Off Broadway that doesn't have a television or a video screen onstage. And while companies like the Builders Association and the Wooster Group integrate technology into their shows in fascinating ways, others are merely using it as decoration, which, more often than not, serves as a hollow distraction.      Take ''Gun Play,'' a high-concept collage of dance, monologues and video about gun culture that is playing in a dank, white box called the Chocolate Factory in Queens. The director, Brian Rogers, has his game young dancers run and march in robotic motions as if they were in a video game, scored with macho quotes from violent films like ''Dirty Harry'' and ''Taxi Driver.'' A row of computers sits in front of the audience featuring violent games in which the player has the perspective of the shooter. At the opening of the hourlong performance, actors talk to the screens: ''Oh baby, bring it, you fruitcake'' and ''Die, die, die!''

4264,George M. Cohan Tonight!,2006-03-09,2006-03-14,By George Hunka,Recapturing an Old Fountain of Euphoria,"Before James Brown, there was George M. Cohan, at least when it comes to the label ''the Hardest-Working Man in Show Business.'' Before his death in 1942, Cohan almost single-handedly invented the American musical comedy, writing more than 50 shows (more than 40 of them before 1920), and hundreds of songs: brash, cocky, energetic and endlessly euphoric. This also describes ''George M. Cohan Tonight!,'' the new one-man musical starring Jon Peterson and devised by Chip Deffaa, at the Irish Repertory Theater.     Set in the prop room of a theater, the show has the spirit of Cohan rising again in Mr. Peterson, as he illustrates the details of his life in show business, punctuating his story with more than 30 songs crammed into a very taut 100-minute running time. Most theatergoers will probably think of either James Cagney or Joel Grey as the Man Who Owns Broadway, but Mr. Peterson, lanky and tall, easily erases memories of both early on as he strides across the seemingly small Irish Rep stage as if it were Radio City Music Hall. And the man can dance: you won't see a buck-and-wing like this on too many stages any more.

But the heroines of Claudia Dey's hysterically funny ''Trout Stanley,'' now having its American premiere at the Culture Project, are role-playing fraternal twins (actually they were triplets, but the third sister, affectionately remembered as Duckling, never quite made it through the birth canal). We meet them on their 30th birthday.      The robust blond Grace (Kelly McAndrew) goes off to work at the garbage dump, secure in the knowledge that she is a hot number, the local ammo shop's latest billboard model. The fragile Sugar (Erika Rolfsrud), who stays home, has reason to fret, and not just because she is considered the less attractive sister.

His story is intercut with the confessional monologue of a young United States Army soldier from West Virginia who, in her role as a guard at a prison for insurgents in Iraq, becomes a scapegoat in a scandal involving photographs of actual abuse.

5168,Haunted,2010-12-08,2006-02-23,By Jonathan Kalb,Toward a Wordless Theater of Death-Haunted Imagery,"Leszek Madzik, whose 40-minute piece ''Odchodzi (Passing Away)'' began a nearly three-week run at La MaMa Annex on Feb. 16, commands enormous respect among those in the know about Polish avant-garde theater. Since the early 1970's, he has been creating small-scale, slow-moving, wordless, melancholy performances that explore concentrated states of mind, organic processes and abstract philosophical and religious ideas. Reports in international theater journals over the years have described his works in hushed tones of reverence, comparing them with the theater of Jerzy Grotowski and Tadeusz Kantor.     Unlike his famous compatriots, however, Mr. Madzik has not had work produced in New York before, and ''Odchodzi'' suggests that he may have waited a few decades too long. For all its doleful visual beauty, the piece's technical modesty and narrative simplicity limit its impact in an environment glutted with sensational media effects. Audiences here are accustomed to sophisticated theater-of-images magicians like Robert Wilson, John Jesurun and Romeo Castellucci (whose stunning ''Tragedia Endogonidia #09 London'' played at Kasser Theater at Montclair State University in October).

She has nice things to say (she loves Mom's meat loaf) but spends a lot of time on the telephone and is soon demanding play dates with a particular poodle. Martha redeems herself when a burglar creeps into the house and she's the only one home. Boy, is he surprised when she calls 911!     Many parents are already familiar with the children's book ''Martha Speaks,'' by Susan Meddaugh, but the story takes on new musical life in the adorable hourlong children's show at the Lucille Lortel Theater.

Gurney's latest play, ''Indian Blood,'' is like a snow globe for the stage, in this case a memento of wintry Buffalo in the mid-1940's. This is not meant unkindly. Who can resist the low-tech charm of those friendly knickknacks? Written with delicacy and old-school craftsmanship, ''Indian Blood,'' which opened last night at the 59E59 Theaters in a Primary Stages production, is a modest memory play that is endowed with a measure of emotional heft by its unchallenged but unusually strong cast.     How small is the play's scope? Well, consider the dramatic jolt that sets the evening's emotional flurries in motion. In the first scene, calamity befalls the narrator and protagonist, the 16-year-old Eddie, when a naughty drawing he whipped up to entertain the boys in the back row in Latin class falls into the hands of his teacher.

5442,Into the Woods,2012-08-09,2006-03-24,By Ben Brantley,"Tolkien's 'Lord of the Rings,' Staged by Matthew Warchus in Toronto","AN hour or so into what feels like eons of stage time, one wise, scared little hobbit manages to express the feelings of multitudes. ''This place is too dim and tree-ish for me,'' mutters a round-ish, twee-ish creature named Pippin, groping through a shadowy forest in the second act of the very expensive, largely incomprehensible musical version of ''The Lord of the Rings,'' which opened Thursday at the Princess of Wales Theater here.

''This place is too dim and tree-ish for me,'' mutters a round-ish, twee-ish creature named Pippin, groping through a shadowy forest in the second act of the very expensive, largely incomprehensible musical version of ''The Lord of the Rings,'' which opened Thursday at the Princess of Wales Theater here.

A blend of poison pen and love letter to the traditional song-and-dance show, spiked with the backstage knowingness of an obsessive theater queen, has been the formula for hits like ''The Producers'' (the rakish father of the trend), ''Spamalot,'' ''Dirty Rotten Scoundrels'' and ''The Drowsy Chaperone.''     The latest entry in this sweet but snarky category is ''Martin Short: Fame Becomes Me,'' the eager and amiably scattershot ''comedy musical'' that opened last night at the Bernard B. Jacobs Theater. It has to be said that Mr. Short, an appealing and immodestly modest (or is it modestly immodest?) performer, arrives a little late at the table for such parody to feel very fresh.

''They don't write musicals like they used to,'' you may have heard more than once, but it turns out that isn't quite right.

Songs employing the carousel as a metaphor for the crazy whirl of life? Songs of romance tinted darkly with reflections on death? Songs that begin as wistful laments for lost youth -- or lost innocence, or lost love, or lost something else -- and gradually, inexorably evolve into stirring anthems to endurance? Songs accompanied by the plaintive whine of the accordion? Songs that sound French even when they are being sung in English?     If you answered one or more of the above questions in the affirmative, you may already know that the celebrated revue ''Jacques Brel Is Alive and Well and Living in Paris'' has been resurrected at the Zipper Theater. While Brel himself is no longer alive or well, and is thus, unlucky soul, certainly not living in Paris, his songs endure, as do the English versions by Eric Blau and Mort Shuman that took New York by storm when this show first opened in 1968 at the Village Gate.
